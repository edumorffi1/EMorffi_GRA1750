								<h3>MARVEL</h3>
								<div class="box">
									<p>Marvel Studios, LLC (originally known as Marvel Films from 1993 to 1996) is an American motion picture studio based at The Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California and is a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios, itself a wholly owned division of The Walt Disney Company, with film producer Kevin Feige serving as president. Previously, the studio was a subsidiary of Marvel Entertainment until Disney reorganized the companies in August 2015.

Dedicated to producing films based on Marvel Comics characters, the studio has been involved in three Marvel-character film franchises to have exceeded $1 billion in North American revenue: the X-Men, Spider-Man, and Marvel Cinematic Universe multi-film franchises. The Spider-Man franchise is licensed to Sony Pictures. Since 2012, Marvel Studios' films are distributed theatrically by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, having previously been distributed by Paramount Pictures from 2008 to 2011. Universal Pictures distributed The Incredible Hulk (2008) and has the right of first refusal to distribute any future Hulk films produce by Marvel Studios, while Sony Pictures Releasing distributed Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and will distribute any future Spider-Man films produced in conjunction with Marvel Studios.

Marvel Studios has released 19 films since 2008 within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from Iron Man (2008) to Avengers: Infinity War (2018). These films all share continuity with each other, along with the One-Shots produced by the studio and the television shows produced by Marvel Television. The series has grossed over $14.8 billion at the global box office, making it the highest-grossing film franchise of all time.</p>
